<p>Request Highlighter is a simple extension for Burp Suite tool (for both community and professional editions) that provides an automatic way to highlight HTTP requests based on headers content (eg. Host, User-Agent, Cookies, Auth token, custom headers etc.).
With Request Highlighter testers can easily identify and point out, within the Proxy history tab, requests belonging to different sessions, hosts, browsers or devices.</p>

<p><b>Usage</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>Under the tab "Proxy" -&gt; "HTTP History" select a request belonging to the type that you want to highlight</li>
    <li>In the "Request" tab, select the header part containing the string of interest (eg. the session cookie, a specific user-agent, a custom header etc.) and right-click on it. NOTE: Currently ONLY headers (or parts of them) can be selected.</li>
    <li>On the context menu click on "Request Highlighter - add highlight" and select the color from the list of available ones</li>
    <li>Every request (also inside the proxy history) that contains the string selected will be automatically highlighted with the selected color. NOTE: BE AWARE of potential conflicts! If a request matches with multiple strings, it will be highlighted with the color of the last string found in the request.</li>
	<li>Repeat the process for every category of requests that you want to highlight (max 8)</li>
	<li>To stop highlighting a specific type of requests: open the context menu and, under "Disable Request Highlighter" select the one that you want to disable.</li>
</ol>
